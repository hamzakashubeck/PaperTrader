# Text-Based Paper Trader

A work in progress! I'm building a text-based paper trader using Python that allows users to simulate buying and selling securities using web-scraped data (and a csv file to keep track of inventory and costs/balances). My goal is also to add a simple GUI after the simulator is functional.
